# DataStructure
***
Hello, here is **Mzdora**.
If you want to find the underlying implementation of data structures.
You can find them here.
**Hope these helps you, in addition, they are written by Java.**
**If you are interested in other programming languages implementation**
Maybe someday I will implement them by Python even Cpp :P.
