# DataStructure
***
Hello, here is **Mzdora**.
If you want to find the underlying implementation of data structures.
You can find them here.
## Hope these helps you, in addition, they are written by Java.
## If you are interested in other programming languages implementation, welcome to Fork.
Maybe someday I will implement them by Python even Cpp :).

```java
public class mzdora{
  public static main(args[] String){
    System.out.println("Find some interesting Data Structures <3");
  }
}
